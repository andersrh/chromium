- Widevine is not a free library and cannot be shipped in fedora.
  You have to get it from Google first and install it under
  /usr/lib64/chromium-browser or /opt/google/chrome if you want
  Chromium to use widevine.

- Chromium uses the system ffmpeg-free library which is included in
  fedora >= 36 and centos-stream 9. This library contains free video
  codecs. If you want Chromium to use non-free video codecs, you need
  to install libavcodec-freeworld from rpmfusion-free.
